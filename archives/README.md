# ARCHIVES

### What is this folder?

This folder is the project's historical archive. It contains old versions, obsolete components, and development artifacts that are no longer in active use but are preserved for reference value.

### What is it for?

Its main goal is to maintain a historical record of development without overloading the main codebase. It allows consulting past implementations or understanding the project's evolution over time.

### What can I find here?

- `obsolete source code`: Old versions of files or modules that have been replaced.
- `previous documentation`: Guides or documents from earlier versions.
- `discarded artifacts`: Any other element that was part of the project and has been retired.

### Usage and examples

The content in this folder is **read-only**. It should not be modified or imported by active code.

- **Example**: If you need to verify how an API worked in version `1.0`, you can look for the corresponding code in this folder to understand its original behavior.

### How to contribute

This folder does not accept direct contributions. Content is only added when a significant part of the project becomes obsolete and needs to be archived by a repository administrator.

### FAQs

- **Can I modify or delete files here?**
  - No. The content is an immutable record. If you believe something should be removed, consult with the project lead.
- **How often is this folder updated?**
  - Sporadically, only when major architectural changes are made or key features are removed.

### References and resources

Not applicable for this folder, as its content is self-referential and historical.
