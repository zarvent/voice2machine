# `voice2machine.egg-info` (generated package metadata)

This directory contains packaging metadata generated by `setuptools` when the Python distribution is built/installed.

## Important

- Treat everything in this folder as **generated output**.
- Manual edits are not durable: the next build/install can overwrite them.

If you need to change what appears here, change the source of truth instead:

- Project metadata: `apps/backend/pyproject.toml`
- Dependencies: `apps/backend/requirements.txt` (runtime) and `requirements-minimal.txt` (minimal)
- Package code: `apps/backend/src/v2m/`

## What the files mean (quick reference)

- `PKG-INFO`: normalized distribution metadata (name, version, requires).
- `requires.txt`: dependency list as resolved by packaging.
- `SOURCES.txt`: file list included in the distribution.
- `top_level.txt`: top-level import packages.

## Common gotchas

- If this folder is missing locally, it usually just means you haven’t done an editable install yet.
  From `apps/backend/`: `pip install -e .` (or `uv pip install -e .`).
