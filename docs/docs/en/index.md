# 🗣️ Voice2Machine: Local Voice Dictation

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal is simple:

> **Be able to dictate text anywhere in your operating system.**

The idea is to transcribe audio using your local GPU for maximum speed and accuracy, regardless of the application you're using (code editor, browser, chat, etc.).

This project transforms a simple script into a robust modular application based on a **Backend Daemon** (Python), designed with Hexagonal Architecture to ensure maintainability, scalability, and absolute privacy.
