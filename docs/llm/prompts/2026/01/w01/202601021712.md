I am using the application frontend, which should function as a remote control for the backend, without being hardcoded. The frontend should not consume resources or execute its own logic; it only manages the visual part of the program.

I detect several communication issues between the frontend and backend:

**Daemon status:** The daemon is started, but the frontend does not display its current status.

**Recording in the studio:** When starting a recording, the note is not created automatically. I need an option to manually open the note, edit it, and add audio—similar to the existing function of adding text to speech. I also want to be able to add new transcripts to those already processed.

**Settings:** In the code, the configured model is LARGE B3 TURBO, but the interface shows TINI. This discrepancy is unacceptable.

**Overview:** It does not communicate correctly with the backend.

**General requirements:**
- Remove all hardcoding.
- Implement best practices and current technologies.
- If Rust offers significant advantages in performance and speed, use it; otherwise, choose the most useful and convenient language.

The goal is to fix the frontend so that it accurately reflects the state and logic of the backend, maintaining the philosophy that the frontend is a remote control for the backend.
